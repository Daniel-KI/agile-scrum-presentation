# üìå AGILE & SCRUM 

Every technology organization today seems to practice the agile methodology for software development, or a version of it. Or at least they believe they do.  But what is agile methodology?

## Agile Manifesto üìë
Agile was formally launched in 2001 when 17 technologists drafted the Agile Manifesto. This is a very important document which had so much impact that it has worked as a bible for Agile development even until today.

## Four major principles ‚ö†Ô∏è

Creators of Agile wrote four major principles for agile project management, with the goal of developing better software:
1)	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2)	Working software over comprehensive documentation
3)	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4)	Responding to change over following a plan

But, while there is value in the items on the right, we should value the items on the left more.

## Features ‚úîÔ∏è

Agile methodologies argue that, above all, we should seek client satisfaction through continuous deliveries of software, by keeping up constant communication with the client and, also, by focusing on communication between team members. Contrary to previous practices, the Agile methodology is not characterized by the complete definition of a product, a complete analysis or the definition of all categories and requirements, but by a dynamic interaction that allows constant delivery.

The meaning of Agile is swift or versatile. Agile process model refers to a software development approach based on iterative development. Agile methods break tasks into smaller iterations, or parts do not directly involve long term planning. The project scope and requirements are laid down at the beginning of the development process. Plans regarding the number of iterations, the duration and the scope of each iteration are clearly defined in advance.
The division of the entire project into smaller parts helps to minimize the project risk and to reduce the overall project delivery time requirements. Each iteration involves a team working through a full software development life cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing before a working product is demonstrated to the client.

## Is this exactly a methodology? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But it should be noted that agile is not really a methodology. If we take time to look at the AGILE Values and Principles, we won‚Äôt find any methodology there. Instead, we find guidance on how to choose methods and procedures that will work best for your team.

# üìå SCRUM FRAMEWORK 

Based on agile was created a lot of frameworks for developing. These frameworks are methods for applying the principles of Agile to a project. Think of Agile as the overall philosophy, and these frameworks as tools you use to carry out that philosophy. Today we will focus on the most widely-used framework that called "Scrum".

## Three categories of Scrum ‚öôÔ∏è

In general Scrum framework consists of three distinct categories: roles, events, and artifacts. Let's start from roles.

## Roles üë§

The Scrum framework is defined by three core roles: the Development Team, the Scrum Master, and the Product Owner. They choose how best to accomplish their work and have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.

- ***Product Owner*** (PO) is responsible for maximizing return on investment by identifying product features and translating them into a prioritized list. The Product Owner decides which features should be at the top of the list for the next Sprint. He/she is also responsible for all product‚Äôs profits and losses, acting as a spokesperson for clients.
- ***Scrum Master*** (SM) is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.  This Scrum Master helps the product team to learn and apply Scrum for reaching all business values. He/she is not a team manager, a project manager, or a team lead, but serves the team, helping to remove impediments, protecting colleagues from outside interference, and helping them to adopt Agile practices.
- ***Development team*** in Scrum includes people working together to develop and deliver the requested and committed product increments. Scrum developers are cross-functional members who are capable to achieve the Sprint goals. The team may include software engineers, architects, system admins, analysts, UI designers, QA experts, etc. They build the product that the Product Owner indicates.
- We can also mention a ***Stakeholder***. Stakeholder is an individual or a group of people who are impacted by the outcome of a product. Stakeholders in Scrum are interested in the product‚Äôs success. They can be within or outside the company that is sponsoring the project. Stakeholders usually keep a healthy relationship with the PO to share important product details. They are responsible for conveying all the wishes and concerns to the PO, providing regular input to queries from the PO.

## Events üìÖ

The next category is events. The Scrum framework is marked by five events. These are the Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

- ***Sprint*** (also called an iteration) is the basic unit of development in Scrum. The sprint is a time-boxed effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The duration is fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.
- ***Sprint planning*** is an event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the product backlog items, they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items.
- ***Daily stand-up*** (also called daily Scrum meeting) is a short organizational meeting that is held each day. The meeting, generally limited to between five and fifteen minutes long, is sometimes referred to as a stand-up, a morning roll-call or a daily scrum.
- ***Sprint Review*** takes place after a Sprint ends. During Review, the Product Owner explains what planned work either was or was not completed during the Sprint. The team then presents completed work and talks through what went well and how problems were solved.
- ***Sprint Retrospective*** is held after the sprint review at the end of each sprint. It offers the team an opportunity to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

## Artifacts üì¶

The last one category is artifacts. Artifacts are just physical records that provide project details. Scrum Artifacts include the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Product Increments.

- ***Product*** backlog is a prioritized list of features, defects, or technical work that has yet to be worked on. It should be work that is considered valuable from the product owner‚Äôs perspective. The Product Owner and the rest of the team work together to review the Product Backlog and make adjustments, when necessary, as product requirements change and evolve.
- ***Sprint backlog*** is a list of all items from the Product Backlog to be worked on during a Sprint. This list is put together by prioritizing items from the Product Backlog until the team feels they‚Äôve reached their capacity for the Sprint. Team members sign up for tasks in the Sprint Backlog based on skills and priorities, following the self-organizing Scrum framework.
- ***Product increment*** is the sum of product work completed during a Sprint, combined with all work completed during previous Sprints. The goal of a Sprint is to produce a Done Product Increment. It‚Äôs up to the Scrum team to agree on what defines an Increment‚Äôs ‚ÄúDone‚Äù status, but all team members need to agree on and understand the definition.

## Life Cycle ‚è≥

The interaction of these three components forms the life cycle of the SCRUM project

- The first step of any Scrum project is the stage of gathering necessary information about the future product. It is the responsibility of the Product Owner. He is the person who contacts the customer to understand his vision of future software. Gathering user stories is also one of his responsibilities.
- After all user stories are collected and all the customer‚Äôs wishes are considered, they are prioritized in a list that is called a product backlog.
- After the prioritization of the product backlog items, they are turned into tasks and divided into several sprints. The team makes it during the sprint planning meetings. The main goal of each meeting is to create a sprint backlog. After the sprint is finished the work of the team will be estimated in accordance with the fulfillment of the sprint backlog requirements.
- The next Scrum step is the process of Sprint execution. It includes a consequent performance of all sprint tasks and everyday evaluation of workflow. The progress of the sprint backlog requirements is evaluated during the daily Scrums ‚Äì the team gatherings where all the positive and negative work issues are discussed.
- After the sprint comes to its end, all members of the Scrum team participate in the sprint review and the sprint retrospectives. These gatherings help to find out what went wrong during the sprint process.
- The final step of every Sprint cycle is the stage of product estimation. The product is evaluated in accordance with the team‚Äôs definition of ‚ÄúDone‚Äù and provided to the customer to obtain his feedback. Then a new sprint starts, and the cycle repeats.
